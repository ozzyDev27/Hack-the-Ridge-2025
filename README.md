# Sixth Sense

**Sixth Sense** is an accessibility-focused monitoring system designed to help loved ones—especially older adults—live safely and independently. By combining video monitoring, sound detection, and helpful contextual guidance, Sixth Sense keeps caregivers informed while giving users support when they need it most.

## Features

* **Fall Detection** – Continuously monitors the environment for potential falls and alerts caregivers immediately.
* **Contextual Assistance** – Provides guidance for everyday tasks, such as locating objects or navigating spaces, particularly for users with poor vision.
* **Live Video Feed** – Streams real-time video from the monitored room, processed via Raspberry Pi, directly to the caregiver’s mobile app.
* **Accessibility-First Design** – Prioritizes ease of use, clarity, and support for those with mobility or vision challenges.

## How It Works

1. A camera installed in the monitored room streams video to a Raspberry Pi.
2. The Raspberry Pi processes video and audio to detect falls, loud distress sounds, or environmental cues.
3. Alerts, notifications, and contextual information are sent to the connected mobile app in real-time.
4. Caregivers can monitor their loved one remotely, while the system provides guidance to the person being cared for.

## Usage

Once installed, Sixth Sense runs automatically in the background:

* Caregivers receive **push notifications** for falls.
* Users can interact with the system for **contextual help**, like finding misplaced objects.
* The system prioritizes **simple, intuitive interfaces** for both caregivers and older adults.

## Story Behind It

Sixth Sense was inspired by my grandfather, who struggles with modern technology. Like many older adults, he finds smartphones and apps intimidating and often feels that he could never learn or understand them. This project was born from a desire to **support loved ones without forcing them to adapt to technology they aren’t comfortable with**.

* The system **works quietly in the background (from the corner of the room)**, respecting the user’s space and routines.
* By combining **fall detection and contextual guidance**, Sixth Sense ensures safety while maintaining independence.

The goal is to **create technology that adapts to the user, makes their life easier, and gives older adults confidence and autonomy** in their daily routines.
