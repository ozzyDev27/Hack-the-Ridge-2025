# Sixth Sense 🧠👀

**Sixth Sense** is an accessibility-focused monitoring system designed to help loved ones—especially older adults—live safely and independently. Using a smart combination of video monitoring, sound detection, and helpful contextual cues, Sixth Sense ensures caregivers stay informed and that those being cared for have assistance when they need it most.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. A camera installed in the monitored room streams video to a Raspberry Pi.
2. The Raspberry Pi processes video and audio to detect falls, loud distress sounds, or environmental cues.
3. Alerts, notifications, and contextual information are sent to the connected mobile app in real-time.
4. Caregivers can monitor their loved one remotely, while the system provides useful guidance to the person being cared for.

## Story Behind It ❤️

Sixth Sense was inspired by my grandfather, who struggles with modern technology. Like many older adults, he finds smartphones and apps intimidating and often feels that he could never learn or understand them. This project was born from a desire to **support loved ones without forcing them to adapt to technology they aren’t comfortable with**.

Accessibility is at the heart of Sixth Sense:

* The system **works quietly in the background**, respecting the user’s space and routines.
* By combining **fall detection, sound alerts, and contextual guidance**, Sixth Sense ensures safety while maintaining independence.

The goal is to **create technology that adapts to the user, and makes their lifestyle easier** and give older adults confidence and autonomy in their daily lives.
