# Sixth Sense 🧠👀

**Sixth Sense** is an accessibility-focused monitoring system designed to help loved ones—especially older adults—live safely and independently. Using a smart combination of video monitoring, sound detection, and helpful contextual cues, Sixth Sense ensures caregivers stay informed and that those being cared for have assistance when they need it most.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. A camera installed in the monitored room streams video to a Raspberry Pi.
2. The Raspberry Pi processes video and audio to detect falls, loud distress sounds, or environmental cues.
3. Alerts, notifications, and contextual information are sent to the connected mobile app in real-time.
4. Caregivers can monitor their loved one remotely, while the system provides useful guidance to the person being cared for.
